# HTML-Webpack-Saas-Boilerplate

A simple HTML page boilerplate with some modern devtools.

## Dev tools

Run `npm install` at the root of the project.

All files can be edited from the `/src` directory.

Available commands:

* `npm run build` Builds a development bundle.
* `npm run start` Watches files and automatically rebuild a development bundle
* `npm run build:production` Builds a ready-for-production bundle with `index.html` in the root directory and all assets in the `/dist` directory.

## TODO

Use `webpack-dev-server` with live reloading.
